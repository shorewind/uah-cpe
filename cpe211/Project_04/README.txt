For input files provided, 
use redirected input to have your 
program read the values.

if your program source code is Project_04.cpp
Then compile the code using the command:
g++ -std=c++11 Project_04.cpp -o Project_04

Alternatively, a Makefile has been provided that
will perform the compiling of your program to
generate the executable.  to run the Makefile,
just type make at the prompt
in the terminal window. 

For the provided Makefile to work, the name of your
source code file must be Project_04.cpp
If you want to use a different name for your source code file, you
will need to edit the Makefile and change all
occurrences of Project_04.cpp to whatever you want to use.


To run your program, type the following command:
./Project_04

To run your program using redirected input with
the input files, use the commands
./Project_04 < P4_in1.txt 
or
./Project_04 < P4_in2.txt
or
./Project_04 < P4_in3.txt
or
./Project_04 < P4_in4.txt
